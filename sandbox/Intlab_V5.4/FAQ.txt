>>> Rounding does not work

    In the INTLAB versions 3.1+ this should no longer happen. 

    For Matlab Version 6 and higher on PCs and Windows, INTLAB is
    entirely written in Matlab. There is no system dependency.

    If you are using Matlab Version 5.3+ on a PC under Windows,
    delete the setround.dll file in directory \intval.

    For other platforms or Matlab Version 5.3-, INTLAB is written
    entirely in Matlab language except one routine

       setround

    for switching rounding mode. A corresponding C-routine together with a
    dll-file is in directory \setround. This routine is the only portability
    constraint (see also function "setround").



>>> Rounding problems with Intel Math Kernel library

    Recent versions of Matlab choose to use IMKL as default for BLAS operations.
    The IMKL library takes full control over the control word forcing internal
    computation to be done in extended and setting the rounding mode to nearest.
    After return to Matlab the control word is reset to its previous value.

    This has peculiar consequences. For example, the results res1 and res2 in

       x = randn(3,1), res1 = x'*x, res2 = x(1)*x(1)+x(2)*x(2)+x(3)*x(3)

    should mathematically be equal. However, res1 is a dot product and computed
    by IMKL, so the intermediate sums are accumulated in extended precision, whereas
    the second result res2 is computed by conventional multiplication and addition
    in Matlab, so intermediate sums are accumulated in double precision. Note
    this peculiarity occurs in ordinary Matlab and has nothing to do with INTLAB.

    Even worse, IMKL switches the control word to "round to nearest", independent
    of its current setting. Therefore, INTLAB cannot work with IMKL. For example,
    define x=intval([1 1e-30 1]), then the results of 
     
       x*ones(3,1)   and   x(1)+x(2)+x(3)

    will be different because the first uses (implicitly) IMKL, the latter does not.

    Since Version 5.1 of INTLAB we test for IMKL and give a corresponding message.
    If you use an older version of INTLAB, you can easily test yourself by
    
       x = 0.1*ones(2,1); d = diam(x'*intval(x))

    The diamater d should not be zero due to rounding errors in the computation of
    diam(x'*intval(x)). If d==0, then you have a newer version of Matlab and use
    the IMKL. In order to make INTLAB work properly, you have to change to another
    BLAS library, for instance the Atlas library which was used up to now by Matlab.
    Unfortunately, I cannot do that from Matlab but the user has to do that outside
    Matlab as a system configuration. 

    For that you have to change the environment variable BLAS_VERSION. From Matlab 
    release notes:

       "If you want to take advantage of the potential performance enhancements 
        provided by the Intel BLAS, you can set the value of the environment 
        variable BLAS_VERSION to the name of the MKL library, mkl.dll. 
        MATLAB uses the BLAS specified by this environment variable, if it exists. 
        To set the BLAS_VERSION environment variable, follow this procedure: Click 
        the Start button, go to the Settings menu, and select Control Panel. On the 
        Control Panel menu, select System. In the System Properties dialog box, 
        click the Advanced tab. On the Advanced panel, click the Environment Variables 
        button. In the Environment Variables dialog box, click the New button in the 
        User variables section. In the New User Variable dialog box, enter the name 
        of the variable as BLAS_VERSION and set the value of the variable to the name 
        of the MKL library: mkl.dll. "

    Please consult 
 
       http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/rn/r14sp1_math_new.html
 
    and "Overriding the Default BLAS Library on Sun/Solaris Systems". 

    So change the system variable BLAS_VERSION to atlas*** choosing '***' according to 
    your processor. You find the atlas files in matlab/bin/win32 . I can't do that from
    INTLAB, sorry for inconvenience.

    To get visual feedback that the BLAS version has changed, also type at the UNIX prompt
 
       % setenv LAPACK_VERBOSITY 1
 
    before starting MATLAB to display diagnostic information while MATLAB is starting 
    up.
 


>>> Erroneous inclusion when using Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem

    There is a new option intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnIgnore') which may
    have been set. With this option input arguments out of range are ignored.
    For example,
       X = infsup(-3,4); Y = sqrt(X)
    yields 
       Y = [0,2] 
    as result ignoring the fact that part of X, namely [-2,0) is not in the 
    (real) range of definition of sqrt. 
    For a continuous function f:R^n->R^n and a nonempty, compact and convex set 
    X in R^n we know by Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem that f has a fixed point 
    in X provided X is mapped into itself by f. 
    Now consider f(x):=sqrt(x)-2. Obviously, there is no real x such that f(x)=x.
    However, f(X)=[-2,0] when ignoring input arguments out of range, so that
    one might falsely conclude that f(X) is contained X !
    The additional check
       flag = intvalinit('RealStdFctsExcptnOccurred')
    will yield flag=1 in the example, revealing that f(X) need only contain the
    set of f(x) for x in X _and_ in the range of definition of f. 
    For more details, see Readme.txt .



>>> Peculiar messages involving 'numel' or even core dump

    There is a known bug in Matlab 7.0.1 and 7.0.4. Try
        feature accel off
    for cure.



>>> Peculiar behaviour when debugging

    Note that rounding is reset to nearest when setting breakpoints.



>>> Peculiar messages appear such as

    "??? Attempt to reference field of non-structure array 'GLOBAL_INTVAL_STDFCTS_PI'. "

    You may have used a "clear global" or "clear all" statement.

    Certain flags like display-mode etc. are stored in global variables.
    Therefore

       ===> try to avoid a statement like "clear global" or "clear all"

    because it clears all global variables and results in subsequent errors
    in INTLAB. The statements "clear" or "clear variables" do not do any
    harm. Try to clear only specific global variables using, for example,
    statements like "clear global v*". Note that all global variables used
    in INTLAB start with "GLOBAL_". Try "who global" to list them.

    If a "clear global" statement is necessary for some reason, let it
    be followed by

       startintlab

    to restore global variables. In fact, this restores the default options.



>>> Interval matrix multiplication seems not correct

Consider


A=infsup([-1,-5;2,3],[1,-4;2,5]), B=A*A, A(1,1)*A(1,2)+A(1,2)*A(2,2) 

intval A =
[   -1.0000,    1.0000] [   -5.0000,   -4.0000]
[    2.0000,    2.0000] [    3.0000,    5.0000]
intval B =
[  -11.0000,   -7.0000] [  -30.0000,   -6.0000]
[    4.0000,   12.0000] [   -3.0000,   17.0000]
intval ans =
[  -30.0000,   -7.0000]


Here the (1,2)-component of B=A*A is too wide. The default is 

intvalinit('FastIVmult')
===> Fast interval matrix multiplication in use (maximum overestimation
          factor 1.5 in radius)

for fast matrix multiplication of two interval matrices. For sharp results,
try

intvalinit('SharpIVmult')
A=infsup([-1,-5;2,3],[1,-4;2,5]), B=A*A, A(1,1)*A(1,2)+A(1,2)*A(2,2)

===> Slow but sharp interval matrix multiplication in use
intval A =
[   -1.0000,    1.0000] [   -5.0000,   -4.0000]
[    2.0000,    2.0000] [    3.0000,    5.0000]
intval B =
[  -11.0000,   -7.0000] [  -30.0000,   -7.0000]
[    4.0000,   12.0000] [   -1.0000,   17.0000]
intval ans =
[  -30.0000,   -7.0000]

There is only a difference if both factors are of nonzero diameter. In that case,
however, 'sharp' multiplication is pretty slow for larger dimensions:

Time in seconds for multiplication of full interval matrices on a 
Pentium III 866 MHz Laptop:

       n       FastIVmult     SharpIVmult

      500         2.3           110

>>> Intervals are not working correctly

    You might have used the following:

    >> Z=[1,2]+i*[-1,1]
    Z =
      1.0000 - 1.0000i   2.0000 + 1.0000i
  
    The brackets in the definition of Z might lead to the conclusion that Z is a 
    complex interval (rectangle) with lower left endpoint 1-i and upper right 
    endpoint 2+i. This is not the case. The above statement is a standard Matlab
    statement defining a (row) vector of length 2. It cannot be an interval:
    Otherwise Z would be preceded in the output by "intval".



>>> slope does not work for matrices

    This has been fixed in the new release



>>> How to handle the warning

>>> Problems with gradient

    Matlab version 7 has its own function 'gradient' for approximating derivatives.
    This creates a conflict with our toolbox. Of course, one may rename or copy the
    Matlab routine, but then functions are not compatible with Matlab without INTLAB.
    If anybody knows a clue, please let me know.




>>> SparseInfNanFlag problems

    This has been fixed in the new release



>>> Interval output too wide

    We claim that INTLAB output of intervals is correct in any format, that means,
    the displayed (decimal) numbers form an inclusion of the computed interval.
    For example,

    >> format short; X = intval(2)/3;
    >> infsup(X), midrad(X), disp_(X)
    intval X = 
    [    0.6666,    0.6667] 
    intval X = 
    <    0.6667,   0.0001>   
    intval X = 
        0.6666

    In short format, the displayed [ 0.6666 , 0.6667 ] is the best possible. For
    display with "_" see "help disp_". 
    
    The next example may seem strange:
    >> format short e, midrad(X), diam(X)
    intval X = 
    <  6.6667e-001, 3.3334e-006> 
    ans =
      1.1102e-016

    So the displayed radius 3.3334e-006 seems much to big. However, it is about
    best possible for the _displayed_ midpoint! 

    But the displayed results are not always best (i.e. as narrow as) possible.
    Consider (thanks to John Pryce for pointing to this)
    
    >> format short, intvalinit('Displayinfsup'), m=succ(0), M=realmax, infsup(m,M)
    ===> Default display of intervals by infimum/supremum (e.g. [ 3.14 , 3.15 ])
    m =
      4.9407e-324
    M =
      1.7977e+308
    intval ans = 
      1.0e+308 *
    [    0.0000,       Inf] 

    This is improvable. Even worse

    >> m8=8*m, infsup(m8,M)
    m8 =
      3.9525e-323
    intval ans = 
      1.0e+308 *
    [    0.0000,       Inf]

    Well, a conversion always accurate to the last digit is a nontrivial task. We used
    a very simple way of conversion, poor men's conversion so to speak. To display some 
    number we convert it into a decimal string using the built-in Matlab routine. Then
    the displayed result is rounded back into floating point. Then correctness with 
    respect to the intended rounding is checked. If not correct, the same procedure is
    performed for a value slightly larger (or smaller) than the given number [see
    S.M. Rump: INTLAB - INTerval LABoratory, in "Developments in Reliable Computing", 
    ed. T. Csendes, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 77-104 (1999)].

    In many if not most cases the displayed result is indeed best possible. For bounds
    near to the underflow or overflow range this is not true. However, at least the
    displayed bounds are correct. So in such cases please check the individual bounds.

    We know that this approach may not be completely satisfactory. Volunteers having a
    better solution, written in Matlab, are very welcome.
